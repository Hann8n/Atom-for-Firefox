## Fluidfox: A Clean Firefox Theme for mac OS
Fluidfox is meant to replace the standard firefox theme with one that has more polish. Uneven spacing has been fixed, harsh 90's-era shadows have been modernized, and native mac OS styling has been added. This theme supports both light and dark mode.

## Surf the web in style with a beautiful theme
Using a privacy-first web browser that lets you block ads shouldn't burden you with bad design.

### Stunning transparency
Use the built-in stunning mac OS transparency with Firefox without editing code yourself.

### Dark mode included
Dim the lights with a built in dark mode. Just set Firefox's theme to Dark or Auto.

### Set of 4k wallpapers included
